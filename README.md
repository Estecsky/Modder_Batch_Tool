* Now it supports **MonsterHunterWorld**, **MonsterHunterRise** and **GranblueFantasyRelink**.
* It has the Chinese translation.
  
# Documentation
Considering creating an instruction document. Most of the functions have been marked on the addon panel.

# Installation
1. Download this addon;
2. Go to File > User Preferences > Addons in Blender;
3. Click on Install Add-on from File, then choose Modders-Batch-Tool.zip archive;
4. If the installation is successful, you can see it in the sidebar in blender (**shortcut key:N**).

# Quickly start 
* When you install the addon for the first time, it will display the MHRise panel by default. You can click **"Show Panel Settings"** to decide which panels you need to display.
* The function of separating by materials temporarily requires the [CATS Addon](https://github.com/absolute-quantum/cats-blender-plugin), which is considered to be independent in the future.
* The material-combiner function is used the same as before, **but it does not merge materials, only images**. This means that you can still separate by materials after it.
